    <h2>JavaScript</h2>
    <p>JavaScript, often abbreviated to JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World
        Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.[11] As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage
        behavior,[12] often incorporating third-party libraries.[13] All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript
        engine to execute the code on users' devices.</p>
    <p>JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[14]
        It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm,
        supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming
        interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document
        Object Model (DOM).</p>
    <p>The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics
        facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.</p>
    <p>JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some servers and a
        variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.
    </p>
    <p>Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages
        are distinct and differ greatly in design.
